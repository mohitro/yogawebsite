                         2. Group classes
                         If exercising on your own is not your thing, or if you prefer to do something different, gyms also offer a variety of group exercise classes. Exercising as part of a group can be great fun. You can try all the different exercise classes that are available. If you would rather do something else, then you can just try a different class the following week!<br>                      
                         3. Motivation
                         Training with other people can be an enormous motivator to help you push yourself that little bit harder! Even if you don't train together, the presence of other people in the gym can have a positive effect.<br>                        
                         4. Having a membership is a great motivator
                         Having a gym membership can really spur you on to keep exercising. After all, you don’t want to keep paying for something you are not using.<br>  
                         5. You can work out alone or with others
                         Perhaps you prefer working out on your own? Or perhaps you like working out with a training buddy? The gym can offer you both.<br> 
                         6. Tailor-made programmes

                        Opening hours:<br>
                        Many have different preferences for when they like to train from early birds at 7 and 7 am till late at night when the gyms empty and you have no distractions. Opening hours is again something you may need to consider depending on your other commitments, child care, working hours etc. Also check weekend opening hours.

                    <p>Yoga improves strength, balance and flexibility. Slow movements and deep breathing increase blood flow and warm up muscles, while holding a pose can build strength. Balance on one foot, while holding the other foot to your calf or above the knee (but never on the knee) at a right angle.
                        Yoga teaches us to forgive ourselves and others. It doesn't make anyone's actions more right; it just liberates each of us from any resentment or anger over something that cannot be changed. We learn from it, forgive it, and move on. Forgiveness doesn't change the past – but it most definitely changes the future.<br>
                        1. Gain Initial Experience In A Safer Environment For Beginners. If you’re completely new to yoga, you might find group classes a little overwhelming.<br>

                        3. Work Around Your Schedule,Busy schedules are one of the top culprits for stopping people from taking care of their mental and physical health. Whether you’ve got to do the school run, head to a meeting or study for a test, there’s always something getting in the way.
                        Most group classes take place early in the morning before people go to work, or in the evening after the finish. If neither of those times works for you, it can be hard to fit your yoga in.<br>
